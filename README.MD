# Read Me, please!
This is just an experiment. In the last year I've worked on few new projects
related to "Amazon Marketplace Web Service" and I've found lot of confusion about feed's submission process.
Online you can find lot of examples and libraries that can helps in the process of submitting
product to the amazon marketplace. But no one of these products helped me reaching my goals because
most of them use the old CSV file submitting process and I don't like that. 

## What this project aims to do?
Is just a workbench, a repository that you can clone and use with docker to made your own
experiments using amazon marketplace webs services. I've mapped few products required by
myself, if you want, you can help me doing the same for remaining products (they are too much).

## Help me.
I've not much time to dedicate to this project, I hope you enjoy it and, if you want, you can
help me too finishing what I've started: complete the list of products to map.
